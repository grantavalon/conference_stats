# NBA Stats by NCAA Conference

I scraped data from sports-reference, matching all NBA players with their respective college conferences. I deployed a [webapp](http://nba-conference-visualization.herokuapp.com/) so you can play around with it a bit. 

Note: Pac-12 and Pac-10 are combined. As a Conference of Champions alum, I couldn't let misleading data make us look bad ;)

Reasons for doing this project include:
* Missing college basketball season
* Being bored on a Saturday afternoon (soccer was the only thing on)
* Wanting to better learn Plotly
* Needing to defend myself against  the wave of Pac hate
* Being genuinely curious to see the answers
